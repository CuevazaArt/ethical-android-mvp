# Agent and contributor orientation (Ethos Kernel)

This file is the **durable entry point** for humans and AI assistants working in this repository. Session chat is not a substitute for what is merged here.

## Read first

- **[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)** — language policy (repo English), process, tests, lint, documentation traceability.
- **[`.cursor/rules/`](.cursor/rules/)** — always-on Cursor guidance (efficiency, documentation credibility, collaboration).

## Integrate solutions, not only explanations

When you fix **security- or safety-critical** behavior (MalAbs thresholds, gates, circuit limits, etc.), **land the full pattern**:

1. Named module defaults (`DEFAULT_*` where appropriate) and tests that lock them.
2. Honest `docs/proposals/` text (English `PROPOSAL_*` when a standalone evidence/limit note is needed).
3. **`CHANGELOG.md`** when reviewers or operators need to see the change.

**Semantic MalAbs cosine defaults** (θ_block / θ_allow): [`docs/proposals/PROPOSAL_MALABS_SEMANTIC_THRESHOLD_EVIDENCE.md`](docs/proposals/PROPOSAL_MALABS_SEMANTIC_THRESHOLD_EVIDENCE.md), implementation [`src/modules/semantic_chat_gate.py`](src/modules/semantic_chat_gate.py), guardrail tests [`tests/test_semantic_chat_gate.py`](tests/test_semantic_chat_gate.py), offline table [`scripts/report_semantic_zone_table.py`](scripts/report_semantic_zone_table.py).

## Product “model” document (theory)

The **complete conceptual model** for the android ethics stack (outside this repo’s code) is referenced from [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) (“Understand the model”). Kernel work is **Python under `src/`**; `landing/` is a separate Next.js app when touched.
